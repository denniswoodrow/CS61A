# UC Berkeley CS61A Fall 2020

Course website: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/

I wanted to gain a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals, so I decided to take UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course taught by the magnaminous professor John DeNero PhD.

This repository contains my solutions for projects, homework, labs, and discussion assignments I completed so far. Open files that contain the assignment name and end in .py or .sql in order to view the code I wrote.
For example, 'hw03.py' or 'lab12.sql'. 

Notes: 
There is no Lab03 because the course curriculum went straight from Lab02 to Lab04. 
I intentionally skipped the following assignments because they deal with computer engineering which is not something I'm interested in pursuing professionally: Lab10, Lab11, Disc10, Disc11, Hw06, Hw07, Hw08.
